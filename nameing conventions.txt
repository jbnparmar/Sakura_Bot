I know, I'm bracking few naming conventions in python
but please bear with it.

To simplify, every package name is in PascalCase
exemple: RelationValueManipulationFunctions.py

and for method names, use underscore "_" to
separate every word
exemple: get_rel_value()

I have not used class in the framework
but, it will be same, we use PascalCase for class name
and underscore for method and function names
