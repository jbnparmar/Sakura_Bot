## What is Sakura_Bot?
I'm trying to create an AI that can pass Turing test and not only that...
(I'm not brave enough to say it yet, what I really want with this AI)

## Why name Sakura?
The name Sakura has nothing to do with Sakura Haruno or "Sakura Uchiha"
from Naruto
The name comes from a japanese film adation of a book called "Kimi no suizou wo tabetai"
or "I want to eat your Pancreas", the female protaganist's name is Sakura.
